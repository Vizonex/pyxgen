# pyxgen
A Cython Bindings Generator Written with Python/Rust (Haven't Completely Decided on it yet). Inspired by many different projects.

# Why A new bindings generator?
To be fair I didn't want to have to do all the work myself but time and time again 
I have been proven wrong. There should be an updated and easy way to generate both
header externs and cdef extension classes without having to do very much. 
Most time in cython is consumed by needing to bind C/C++ libraries alike by making
a tool that can generate all of that this time spend can be cut off significantly.
If rust-bindgen could do it so could we. 

In the future My plan is to use this library to create a brand new Cython Generated 
Version of libclang that we can use to further enhance this project. 

The Project's goal is to remain AI-Free. Based on the principle that Teaching yourself 
how to do something will allow you to learn something.
